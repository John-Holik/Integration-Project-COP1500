# Integration-Project-COP1500
This is a program from my COP1500 class. It is my first ever created program where I was given creative freedom. 
This differs greatly from what I originally planed on doing, but I am still happy with the end result.
The main goal of the program is to showcase my ability to use many basic python functions.
I hope you enjoy!
